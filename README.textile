h1. require_all

A wonderfully simple way to load your code.

Tired of futzing around with require statements everywhere, littering your code
with <code>require File.dirname(__FILE__)</code> crap?  What if you could just 
point something at a big directory full of code and have everything just 
automagically load regardless of the dependency structure?  

Wouldn't that be nice?  Well, now you can!

 <code>require 'require_all'</code>

You can now require_all in a multitude of different ways:

 <code>require_all *args</code>

One of the easiest ways to require_all is to give it a glob, which will 
enumerate all the matching files and load them in the proper order. For 
example, to load all the Ruby files under the 'lib' directory, just do:

 <code>require_all 'lib/**/*.rb'</code>

If the dependencies between the matched files are unresolvable, it will 
throw the first unresolvable NameError.

Don't want to give it a glob?  Just give it a list of files:

 <code>require_all Dir.glob("blah/**/*.rb").reject { |f| stupid_file(f) }</code>
 
Or if you want, just list the files directly as arguments:

 <code>require_all 'lib/a.rb', 'lib/b.rb', 'lib/c.rb', 'lib/d.rb'</code>
 
It's just that easy!  Code loading shouldn't be hard, especially in a language
as versatile as ruby.

h2. Methodology

I didn't invent the approach this gem uses.  It was shamelessly stolen from
Merb.  Once upon a time at MountainWest RubyConf we were discussing how 
horrible ActiveSupport's dependencies.rb hijacking of const_missing and
someone described the approach Merb used to me.  It was so simple and clean!
Here's how it works:

# Enumerate the files in the glob
# Try to load all of the files.  If we encounter a NameError loading a 
  particular file, store that file in a "try to load it later" list.
# If all the files loaded, great, we're done!  If not, go through the
  "try to load it later" list again rescuing NameErrors the same way.
# If we walk the whole "try to load it later" list and it doesn't shrink
  at all, we've encountered an unresolvable dependency.  In this case,
  require_all will rethrow the first NameError it encountered.
